## JavaScript Simple Linked List

This project is an implementation of a simple linked list made without using any of the librarys provided by the language, in this case, JavaScript, which is the language we used to make the project

## Technologies Used

List the main technologies used in the project.

- JavaScript

## Prerequisites

In order to run this JavaScript project, make sure you have the following:

-Visual Studio Code (Live Server extension)
-WiFi connection

Also, even thought it is not neccesary, it is also recommended to have Node.js installed on your device, the latest version


## How to run 

The most optimal way of running this javascript project is by using Visual Studio Code and having the "Live Server" extension, if you desire to run this project this way, the extension is a must

1. Install the "Live Server" extension
2. Once you are sure the extension is installed, go to the index.html class
3. Once you are here, press "right click" and then "Open with live server"
4. This should open your most used browser with a blank page that should have as a link
 "http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html" or something similar, this means its working
5.  Press the "F12" key or use the command "Ctrl+Shift+I" for windows and linux, or "Cmd+Options+I"
for Mac; this should open the DevTools 
6.  On the DevTools, go to the "Console" tab and you should see the result of the tests of this project

We strongly advice to use this way of running the project, since it is the one we had less incovenients with, other possible way would force you to install node.js on your device, so this procedure is the best.
